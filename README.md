# House price prediction
In this assignment, I used multiple regressors to predict house prices.
I implemented several Handler classes for preprocessing data. I implemented it by extending the Sklearn BaseEstimator and TransformerMixin.  
I used Sklearn pipelines for flexible machine learning workflow.
